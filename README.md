# Spin-fixer-for-F14

This addon detects when the aircraft you are flying enters that glitched, wild spin. It then resets your aircraft while preserving your airspeed, altitude, and heading for the most part. This addon makes flying aircraft affected by this glitch quite a bit more flyable.

This addon works for any aircraft affected by this glitch. The XB-70 and F-14 are most commonly affected, but other CC aircraft may be subject to this glitch.

To run this, copy and past "Spin fixer.js" into the console.
